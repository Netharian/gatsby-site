Quests

- Characters who had the "Match Made in Zereth Mortis" quest incorrectly automatically completed and became blocked on the Campaign chapter will now have the quest available to them when they next zone into Zereth Mortis.
  - _Developers’ note: Enterprising players who found a way to unlock all the teleporters in the area and proceed along the quest line without the quest will be allowed to proceed as normal, without needing to backtrack to this quest._
